This page gives a summary about my education, work experience, and what I like to do for fun!

I plan on graduating from Allegheny College with a major in both Computer Science and Economics. While also here I played four year on the varisty baseball team and founded the Allegheny Bowling Club, acting as the vice president for three years.

Over the past two summers I have interned at Federated Hermes located in Pittsburgh PA. My first intership dealt in managing databases for financial applications, and the second one having me create and run test cases on company sites, to ensure quality. Whille here I alos participated in the annual Hackathon challege both years I was there, taking second the first year, and being able to win the top prize the second year.

Outside of looking at financial markets I also enjoy many other activites both physically and mentally rigorous. I am a big fan of sports, having competed in baseball, bowling, soccer, and ski frequently. I have been playing the piano since second grade, while I do not have the chance to play as much anymore. Also enjoy computers, understanding how the work both on a physical and computational level, and how to increase their performance.
