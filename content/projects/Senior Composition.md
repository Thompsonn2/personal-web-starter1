To try and predict price movements is a difficult task. There are many different methods to doing this, but one of the best ways to do this is through technical analysis. Technical Analysis uses the characteristics of past price points to predict price movements. By looking at the way prices move, the direction of the future prices can be predicted. One issue with technical analysis is it needs to consistently read the signals the same way. To solve this problem genetic algorithms are used to read the signals given by technical analysis tools and execute the corresponding trades.
