This project was implemented to trade securities based on moving average crossovers. Looking at moving averages can indicate whether a security is thought to be overbought or oversold, indicating potential entry and exit points. While this program does not handle live data, it provides interesting results that can be useful to keep in mind for real time scenarios.

We'll assume here that you have a good understanding of Hugo and its structure. If you have any doubt, check the [Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/ "Hugo documentation"); it is pretty good and the community quite active! Thank you so much by the way! :muscle:

The first thing to do when starting your own website is to **copy the content of exampleSite** in your own root folder. This way, you can have a sample of `config.toml` file and a first structure.

**Don't forget to change the `baseURL` param to avoid deployment failures**

Browse the articles in the `content/post` folder to get any help during setup or using the theme. Please, [contact me](https://baptistej.com "contact me") if you have any problem using the them.

Then **configure the `config.toml` file** to match your need.

You should then write you home (`/content/_index.md`), create your first project (see the [portfolio definition](/content/post/portfolio-definition.md "portfolio definition") and your first blogpost.

Lastly, define the menu in the sidebar: you can get some help in the `/content/post/manage-your-menu.md` file.
